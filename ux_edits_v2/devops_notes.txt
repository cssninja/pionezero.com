1
if you need help with details or want me to create a revised user story or task let me know

2
there were three 'BIGGEST BUILD' (3) phases which took the lion's share of my time:

(a) the protypes for the PEAK site (not included in dev ops)
(b) setting up all 60 users and their respective custom fields (for variables)
(c) and the core functionality of the PEAK site: multiple user logins where their logo and color palette dynamically load with a login .. this was located in past sprints as well

3
then there were eight considered a 'MAJOR BUILD' (8) which pretty much also took the lion's share of my time (creating components from scratch in the bootstrap framework, or major page overhauls) .. they were also located in past sprints and went through their evolution there

4
five required a moderate amount of coding to align the layout for all viewports (mobile, tablet and desktop) .. labeled 'MODERATE' (5) above .. these pages are generally in the UX of a purchase, from start to finish .. they were also located in past sprints and kind of 'collected dust' until i got to them as i was focused more on the BIGGEST BUILD or MAJOR BUILD user stories

5
the rest (5) i considered a 'SUB PAGE' (5) which i relegated to last in attention as not much coding was required .. these also were located in past sprints and kind of 'collected dust' until i got to them as i was focused more on the BIGGEST BUILD or MAJOR BUILD user stories

user stories + tasks migration from sprint 005 to tech rocks

--BIGGEST BUILD--
THIS IN NOT LOCATED IN DEV OPS .. but i initially was tasked with creating a prototype for the PEAK site (before WILD had acquired the account), which included:

1) abobe xd files for the login page, the storefront page and the product page
2) i am able to work fast in the bootstrap framework so i actually created for erin and jamie two LIVE pages for the login and storefront, which were completed, ready-to-use pages .. these assets are located here:

user story > 4300 global header and footer - PEAK

task > 4481 redesign global .. (READY FOR PEER REVIEW)

* this user story is under sean's name but the global header was a MAJOR BUILD for me as it was 1) completely redesigned in the bootstrap framework and 2) contains a lot of 'universal code' that applies to other pages as the global header loads in all pages and is high in the DOM (document object model) .. so added a task

* code documentation is in my dev site map here in header section:

--BIGGEST BUILD--
user story > 4334 setup users and custom fields - PEAK

task > 4380 add location .. (READY FOR PEER REVIEW)

this user story was under sean's name but i changed it to mine as i had to manually set up all 60 users (.csv upload was not working) and add thier respective custom fields (for variables)

--BIGGEST BUILD--
user story > 4351 site theming based on customer location - PEAK

this user story is intertwined with the tasks of user story 4334 .. the color palette setup, code set up, documentation and implementation took a huge amount of time for me as this is the core feature and novelty of PEAK, multiple user logins .. it required:

1) creating four color palettes (following the design guidelines)
2) identifying small code sections (in the UX of buying a product)
3) documenting all those code section in a master file
4) creating 'variables' and parking that code in the global header (sean worked with me in this part then i later learned to create the variables myself)
5) inserting those variables in about 14 code sections throughout the site to replace the normal CSS
6) assign those variables to all 60 users in a master file
7) list those users manually in the customers tab (.csv upload was not working)
8) then test everything
