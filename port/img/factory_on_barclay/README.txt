IMAGE FILES
-------------------

** Note: I've already color matched the CMYK and RGB files so that in Preview on a Mac they look 97% similar. I just checked them in Dropbox and they look different but this could be because how CMYK is rendered in a browser. In Preview they appear almost identical. So I'm pretty sure the big difference in the browser is just a browser rendering issue, maybe Dropbox compressing files (just for viewing).

CMYK.eps

This file has a document color mode of CMYK and is to be used ONLY FOR PRINT.

You can zoom as much as you want and it won't lose resolution because it is vector-based.

I color matched this CMYK file as closely as possible to the RGB appearance, mostly by eye. FIles output into CMYK color mode differ significantly to the same file in RGB, so I tweaked the colors as much as possible so the RGB files and CMYK file looked almost identical (maybe 97%.)

** Please don't alter the file with respect to design .. request any edits from me so I can do this from the master file, and so the final product is accurately represented in my resume.

LOGO.jpg

This file has a document color mode of RGB and is to be used ONLY FOR WEB.

It has a limited zoom capability because it is bitmap based.

LOGO_rgb/cmyk.jpg

This file can also be used for extraxcting the RGB bitmap logo, but it's mostly for seeing the RGB and CMYK specs and font names.
