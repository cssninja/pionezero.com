Meilyn is it possible for you to go through this todo tonight? A lot of what I’m doing in the beginning is:

1) information architecture
2) UI/UX

which is dependent on most of what’s in this todo .. thanks!

Immediate todo ..

1. Buy the template - DONE
2. Get a site map from you (menu basically and pages you want)
3. Tell me what vibe you want the site to have .. emotional appeal that is
4. What ‘look and feel’ do you want the site to have .. design appeal
5. Some more details on the specs of your corporate identity I’ll design:
  a) preferred color palette
  b) font style
  c) what feeling do you want to evoke
  d) what design style do you prefer
6) Send me pics from the photo shoot

The Dropbox link for uploading the photoshoot images (and anything else) is:

Thanks!
Marcus
