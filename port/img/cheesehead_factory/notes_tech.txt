I want to add a button on all product pages that says 'Book' or "Schedule' but I don't know where in the code to find it. I'm a web developer so I can read code but just don't know where the product page buttons are.

In the SOURCE CODE i DID find them though:

      <div data-shopify="payment-button" class="shopify-payment-button"><button class="shopify-payment-button__button shopify-payment-button__button--unbranded shopify-payment-button__button--hidden" disabled="disabled" aria-hidden="true"> </button><button class="shopify-payment-button__more-options shopify-payment-button__button--hidden" disabled="disabled" aria-hidden="true"> </button></div>

I'm a Shopify Partner as well so I was told you can get us tech support from the author of the template, correct? The template is Colors:

https://themes.shopify.com/themes/colors/styles/generic

I"m going to be calling you shortly .. will these email be available to look at?

Kind regards,
Marcus
