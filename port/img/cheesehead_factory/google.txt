where at the bottom there are three links:

Getting ecommerce data from your site to Analytics
To see this data in your reports, you need to:

1) Implement Universal Analytics on your site.

THREE CODE SNIPPETS NOW, not the old single one >

Get a new and more flexible tracking code that lets you collect data from any digital device
Universal Analytics introduces three new versions of the tracking code you can implement to meet your specific technical needs. Use the GTAG.JS JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY FOR WEBSITES, the ANALYTICS SDKS (V2.X OR HIGHER) FOR MOBILE APP TRACKING, and the MEASUREMENT PROTOCOL FOR OTHER DIGITAL DEVICES, like game consoles and information kiosks.

2) Configure gtag.js to use enhanced ecommerce.
