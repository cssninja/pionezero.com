Hi Marcus, 
Yes, I want to go ahead. I need a simple page right now, that says:

Our doors are closed temporarily because of Covid 19, but we are open for Contact-Free Curbside Pickups, Free Friday deliveries with a $20 purchase and shipping Mon-Friday, anywhere! 

Email your ORDER, Name, & Phone No. to chocolatechisel@gmail.com by 2pm for same day pick-up or Friday delivery ( Marcus, we are going to create a new email just for Curbsides and Delivery, I will get that to you next week)

We will call you to arrange Shipping,  Curbside Pick-Up or delivery, and Payment

•Curbside: Tuesday-Sunday / 3pm-5pm
•Delivery: Free with $20 purchase
   Fridays Only / Port Washington & Saukville
• Shipping / Anywhere/ Monday-Friday

Let me know when you want the photos. I do want a sidebar with 1) Year Round Chocolates ( This one will have sub-catagories) 2) Easter 3) Mother's Day 4) Halloween 5) Thanksgiving 6) Christmas 7) Valentine's Day

For now I am taking all photos with my cell phone, and later when I have time, I will photograph each one with my real camera professionally and replace them one by one. Right now I have all my Easter Bunnies photographed. 

Thanks Marcus. Lets talk soon, 
Elizabeth

Hi Marcus, 
Can you please redirect our current website to our Chocolate Chisel Facebook page? Please? Our old website has almost nothing of what we have now. OR just have Big cartel come up for now, and get rid of the rest? And make sure the link works to our chocolatechisel@gmail.com email address? Thanks for letting us know. Elizabeth

Thanks so much. And maybe just the message about closed temporarily because of Corvid 19, and the directions on how to email etc, that I sent you before. Thanks Marcus. I really appreciate whatever you can do. Just let me know what you decided to do, so I know. Thanks again. E

Hi Marcus, 
Here is the info I think you need. 

C Panel Login: gubz4t4wx3v4
she gave us a generic password, that we need to change. 
pass

She said there is no SSL certificate on Big Cartel. She didn't know if it comes with Shopify, but if Shopify doesn't have it, we can purchase it from GoDaddy. We don't have it because we are on the Deluxe Shared Hosting plan right now with GoDaddy. Only the Ultimate or Maximum plans have it. She also said something about a record and DNS manager but I didn't know what she meant.

Hope this is what you were looking for. Thanks, 
Elizabeth
