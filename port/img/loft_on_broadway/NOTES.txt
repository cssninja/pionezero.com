developer notes
-----------------------------

starting from here somehow shows more templates
https://developers.squarespace.com/
click 'all templates'

1
pick any template for business card

2
make duplicate and put in developer mode

3
DEVELOPER MODE WON'T SHOW IN PREDESIGNED TEMPALTES UNLESS PICKED FROM DEVELOPER HOMEPAGE (developer templates will however)
https://developers.squarespace.com/

4
can load multiple templates .. just change domain

5
developer mode right away remove predesigns .. even after adding images doesn't show (so not sure how stable this system is)

6
squarepeace has no:

- mobile testing and editing capability (cross-platform readiness and fixes)
- no built in code editor
- only has GIT environment full code access
- no third party apps
- klunky platform (developer mode works when it wants to)
- templates are not organized
- no phone support

you get what you pay more essentially .. its cheaper bcs its not on par with shopify in terms of both quality and capability

empahsize NAILING 1909 look and feel (Pritzlaff COPIED FACTORY!!!)

transparent large logo (OVER IMAGE) emphaszing turn of the century old milwaukee
BEAMS AND METAL IMAGE OF SPACE AS FIRST IMAGE

FULL SCREEN IMAGE WITH NO MENU OR SECONDARY ICONS .. only appear WITH SCROLL
https://pritzlafflofts.com/project/307/

SUBTLE industrial header (on scroll)

IN YOUR FACE and SUBTLE turn of the century milwaukee LOOK AND FEEL

improve 4-square image block .. something different .. do better flow of UX (this 4-square imagery is haphazzard and nearly useless) >> MAP OUT UX GOALS FOR FIRST PAGE

WAY more refined deep dive into secondary pages (the SPACES > main .. loft .. kitchen .. all)

DO NOT COPY OR THE BRAND, UI/UX WILL BREAK

gallery sux on desktop .. redesign and keep simple .. just LARGE IMAGES and litle coding

no home link in header

seems like original logo design is aligned with ART DECO kinda
https://duckduckgo.com/?q=art+deco+typeface&t=brave&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images

ART DECO began mid to late 1800's, officallly recognized 1901

https://99designs.com/blog/design-history-movements/art-deco-design/

also coincides with VICTORIAN era and design, roughly 1837-1901

design styles mentioned in building design description >

SOLAR BOLD font very much like original, only is art deco

design thinking

building outline with loft on top, broadway in middle

like gilette image .. stuff on side like >
bubble lounge in circle
est in 1890

art deco greek edges

MOON icon >
drinking is night activity
tying in with charcoal
especially is an art nouveau theme

maybe even sun + moon face together (in design thinking images), or moon on top with sun on bottom as in art deco img

charcoal background as nighttime sky

little shooting star

star field

color palette > charcoal + dull gold .. or charcoal + creame city brick

can draw some things, take picture then vecyor it

champagne bubbles can turn into stars
