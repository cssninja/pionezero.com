Let's catch up today about the web-site. 
Old World Luxury is NOT the theme.

Elegant, SOHO feel is more accurate- modern chic.
Please remove those words.

The message is getting mixed for guests viewing the site and our renderings.

Here is a web-site that has some concepts that we could use.

I'd almost rather take the site down and fix or come up with a more accurate theme asap.

Here is the bar rendering:
