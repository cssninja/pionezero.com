all the icons are in the folder ICONS.

2
all the main editing of the icons is in the file ICONS.psd.

3
within the folder ICONS is a folder called BUY_THESE .. the license for each icon is about $2, so 13 icons = $26 .. i would have purchased them myself but could not afford it at the time so i nabbed them from the browser with the intent to purchase later ;).

4
within the folder ICONS are separate folders (cart, checkmark, flask, etc) and within those folders is another folder called 'original', which is where the links are to purchae the license for that particular icon .

5
also in each particular icon folder is a folder called ''AI_vevtor' .. process as follows >

a) edited the orignal .png image in photoshop
b) sent it over to illustrator to be smoothed by turning it into a vector
c) those files outputted by illustrator as .ai and .eps files
d) edited again in photoshop

6
all of the above is the same for the folder LOGO .. same folders .. same process.

7
the image files (.png, .jpg or .png) not in a special folder are images outputed from photoshop to be used on the web site, etc .. and different iterations of each .. click around and you can tell.

8
for the folders TREE_ICON and NEURON_ICON in the folders JANGOBIO and LAB respectively are pretty much the same thing as above .. a folder called 'original', a folder called AI_vector and images in no folder (.psd, .jpg and .png) that came from photoshop.

9
the only image i could not find the original iconfinder link to was the heart image (folder 'HEART') .. i looked high and low and could not find it .. so maybe write to the iconfinder web site (https://www.iconfinder.com/) to obtain that licence .. the original search link was titled 'disease, health, hypertension icon' and the original file name (that actually came from iconfinder) is 'hypertension-512.png'.

10
as far as webflow, i had the sites published to the web from time to time to share links .. and google had indexed them (found in a search) but i have UNPUBLISHED them both so google should purge the sites from it's cache shortly.

11
i'll be keeping the webflow account so i can refer at least to the prototypes in my portfolio .. these links are special unpublished 'read only' links meant for sharing with clients etc .. those links are:

LAB
https://preview.webflow.com/preview/marcuss-fabulous-project-92407f?utm_source=marcuss-fabulous-project-92407f&preview=943814a73d2e316dabe0df9870f6f93c

JANGOBIO
https://preview.webflow.com/preview/marcuss-fabulous-project-a23b21bc77cb67?utm_source=marcuss-fabulous-project-a23b21bc77cb67&preview=943814a73d2e316dabe0df9870f6f93c

click the little 'eye' icon on the upper left to get out of editor mode and into regular site mode.

12
these pages above (both the editor and regular site modes) WON'T BE INDEXED BY GOOGLE because webflow wrote into the code of the above pages 'noindex' (i checked the source code in both pages and in both modes .. checks out!)

*** THE LATEST VERSION OF THE TREE IS IN THIS PATH *** >

JANGOBIO > TREE_LOGO > v2 > sampling

and within that folder 'sampling' is the before (v1) and after (v2) image overlay >

composite.jpg

and all the LOGO editing is done in >

JANGOBIO > TREE_LOGO > TREE.psd

LAB > NEURON_LOGO > new_lead_logo.psd

14
in photoshop, the layers in blue or purple usually indicate the 'final' versions (most refined) to be used as the final product.

also in photoshop in the file ICONS.psd, the layers towards the top have the highest interation and are the ones saved.

in illustrator, the layers marked '_v' in the layer name indicates that layer was turned into a vector using TRACE .. i'll sometimes label a photoshop layer with '_v' in it as well, meaning it came from an illustrator trace (in order to smooth the edges, done way better in illustrator by redrawing the whole image as a vector with the trace tool, outputted as a .ai file and a .eps file).
