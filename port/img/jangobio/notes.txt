email to get everything started:

Craig is this still your email?

Hey sorry I won't be in Madison this week as I've had to reschedule everything due to a little trip that my design partner and I had to reschedule (he was my ride to Madison). But I'm working behind the scenes still:

1) researching models (like pharma sites and scientist's sites)
2) preparing to code a custom CMS for your site
3) digging into branding your new startup

With respect to branding (for your startup company, not your lab site), can you provide me a little direction on what principles you want your 'brand' to represent? By 'brand' I mean the 'look and feel' of the visual design that will embody your LOGO and all visual aspects of your company site (which I can incorporate into yoru lab site as well). For instance:

1) overall concept of the company's work
2) the closest color palette (or if there is none that is fine too)
A: SORT OF OPEN .. REPRESENTS LIFE, LONGEVITY HOPE FUTRE WELL BEING HEALTH OPTIMISM ENTHUSIASM

GREEN COLOR PALETTE

A: GREEN BLUE AQUA (TURQUOISE .. LIKE WATER IS LIFE)

3) any symbols in mind that would represent this startup?
A: A CROSS (RELIGIOUS) .. NEED TO SUGGEST VITALITY .. GREEN OK BUT NOT DARK .. CIRCLE (CIRCLE OF LIFE, CELLS)

4) what is the company's target audience?
5) what feeling or response would you like your logo to evoke?
A: OPTIMISM FOR FUTURE .. SOMEBODY WHEN 18-25 WHOLE FUTURE IN FRONT OF THEM

PRODUCT:
CELL THERAPY .. STEM CELL THERAPY

BASIC IDEA OF COMPANY .. TO REJUVINATE BY TESTES AND OVARIES .. TO REGENETE SAME CELLS AS PRODUCED WHEN YOUNGER (IN JANGO SITE) .. INCREASING HORMONES FROM GONADS

NOT GROWTH HORMONE!! CRAIG: LEADS TO SHORTER LIFE SPAN (STUDIES)

ATHLETES AGES SLOWER .. BCS ELEVATING SEX HORMONES

READ JANGO SITE .. NEED TO UNDERSTAND MESSAGE THERE.

I think answering these would be enough to get started on 'branding' your startup.

Thanks!!
Marcus

invite to SLACK

Hi Craig,

Marcus here .. I'm setting up a communication infrastructure that is better than email .. it's called SLACK (I didn't design it ha .. just use it!) and it is LIVE CHAT via 'channels' I invite you to. So I sent you an invite to SLACK. Just:

1) go to pionezero.slack.com
2) create a username and password
3) then I will create your own channel called '#lab_jango' and just join it

the NOVELTY of SLACK is that it is live chat, chat's are stored neatly (and in MULTIPLE channels if you wish) as opposed to information being lost in strings of emails .. you can store files (or link to them) .. lots of cool things in SLACK so just click around. Oh and we can add team members to your channel(s) if you want them to participate .. and if you want a private channel you just don't invite others to it. SLACK is available via a browser, a desktop app or a mobile app. It would be a great tool for your lab!
