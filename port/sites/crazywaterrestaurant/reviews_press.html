I've usually ordered the steak specials or dishes on the menu. This is one of the few restaurants that understand "rare". I have also had a few fish dishes as well and the fish is always perfectly tender and well seasoned. I always order the BBQ Shrimp the sauce it comes in is lick your plate clean good.

        <p>"Sporting a new menu these days is the only restaurant in Milwaukee - the only restaurant I can think of - that's a little bit crazy. "Crazy" in name only. Okay, this thread is silly. Let me get to the point. Crazy Water, helmed by the ever-talented Peggy Magister, has a new summer menu (839 S. Second St., 645-2606). Perfectly in keeping with the Crazy theme - which is modern, worldly takes on fish, steak, chicken, pork, etc. Magister and I chatted a bit about it over the phone the other day. If you're a Crazy regular, you won't feel like she's pulled the rug out from under you. The roasted beet salad remains. The lemon-parsley crusted halibut and hanger steak au poivre are still in the house. New entrees: veal scaloppini with Gruyere-potato gratin, coriander-crusted lamb tenderloin and crispy potato cake, Provencal fish stew, and chicken mole stuffed poblano with Spanish rice ($18-$29). The little wraparound patio - seating for 24 - is open, too."<br />

        <p>"Whether its co-owner Peggy Magister or one of her staff, -whoevers searing and sauteing at Crazy Water is visible through the restaurants front window. Cooking back to back with the bartender gives Crazy Water its hook, but the place would be nothing without Magisters hot-to-trot menu. After a late-winter trip to Puerto Rico, she got Latin happy with the menu - but just a little. New dishes since that trip, all of which meet my approval, are sauteed empanadas with goat cheese and sun-dried tomato filling, hanger steak with chimichurri sauce and lemon- and parsley-crusted halibut. That long-running flat-iron steak with cherry sauce is a winner, too. Entrees $18-$28. 839 S. Second St., 645-2606."<br />

She wrote: 'Recently I had one of the nightly dinner specials at Crazy Water. The main entree was a delectable veal tenderloin; the side dishes included sauteed spinach and a wonderful blue cheese bread pudding that I would love to be able to duplicate at home. I think it could be made ahead, which would make it ideal to serve when entertaining.'  Peggy Magister, chef and owner, sent the recipe (Crazy Water Blue Cheese Bread Pudding)."<br />

        <p>"Get the best of both worlds at Crazy Water---the historic charm of an early twentieth century bar combined with the intriguing taste of creative contemporary cuisine. The establishment boasts linen-covered tables with fresh flowers, vintage hardwood floors and a classic tin ceiling. Paintings by local artists add to the warm atmosphere. Chef-owner Peggy Magister creates wonders with savory appetizers---seared pepper tuna, garlic chicken wontons and goat cheese-sun-dried tomato empanadas among them. We recommend the Provencal fish stew with shrimp, sea scallops, Prince Edward Island mussels, littleneck clams and pork belly in a saffron-shrimp broth with grilled polenta. For a satisfying finale, opt for bread pudding made with Door County cherries, chocolate chips, butterscotch sauce and vanilla ice cream."<br />
